# hello-world

Hello there curious readers!

My name is what you probably allready figured out, Olof. I'm studying Mekatronics-Engineering at Chalmers in Sweden.
I live with my fiancee and our little cat in a flat just outside Gothenburg. 
Consider myself quite new to programming and i am trying to be a better one with help of github and some projects i have.
